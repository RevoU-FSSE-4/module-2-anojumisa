# Children of Indonesia

Children of Indonesia (COI) is a photography journal created by Ano Jumisa, who travels throughout Indonesia to capture the stories and experiences of its children. This project draws inspiration from Human of New York, a similar project by photographer Brandon Stanton, but with a specific focus on Indonesian children.

Through stunning photographs and engaging narratives, COI showcases the beauty and richness of childhood in diverse regions of the country. Ano ventures beyond the joyful and exciting moments to reveal the unique stories and challenges faced by children in different parts of Indonesia. This website provides a comprehensive look at the project, offering:

-   Complete stories: Go beyond the social media snapshots and delve into the full narratives behind each child's experience.
-   Travelogue: Join Ano on his journey across Indonesia, discovering the diverse landscapes and cultures that shape children's lives.
-   Behind the scenes: Explore the creative process, photography techniques, and challenges faced in capturing these authentic stories.
-   Project uniqueness: Understand what sets COI apart from other initiatives and its contribution to raising awareness about Indonesian children's lives.

## Features

-   Hidden navigation
-   An image of a kid riding a large eagle decoration
-   CSS animation for grid sections, and
-   A carousel featuring highlighted children's images with a hover effect.

## Navigation Bar

Using a curtain menu in the navigation, the navbar is intentionally hidden from view, allowing the hero image to be displayed in full screen. To access the navigation menu, users can click the three dots at the top of the screen, causing the menu to slide down from the top, covering the entire screen.

## Main Section

For the main section, I used a 3x3 grid to contain three sections of image showcases: one big image in the middle section and two small images along with their stories on the left and right sides.

The left and right side containers can be animated on hover. The left side image will move 300px to the top, and the right side image will move 300px to the bottom from their original positions.
